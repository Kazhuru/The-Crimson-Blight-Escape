  storyText: Now that I'm out ready for action I'm wondering my next step, I have
    to get out of the town the quick as possible, but I don't have a car as I always
    have used the public transport to move around...
  conversationText: "1- I think I have enough money walk to the nearest Train station
    and get a ticket to get out of here.\r\n2- I'll probably need that money later
    and those rusty trains aren't that safe, I'll try to steal a car.\r\n3- Hell!
    the fastest to run anywhere out the better chance I'll have to survive, that simple
    right?"
