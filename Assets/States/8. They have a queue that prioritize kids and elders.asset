  storyText: The old lady tells me that I can't get a ticket because there is a priority
    to save child's and elder people from the catastrophe, I have to think quickly
    if I still want to get my ass on a Train...
  conversationText: "1- See miss my very own child already got a ticket and is on
    the next Train schedule, also I'm pregnant! so if you don't want to destroy a
    young family better I can buy one ticket.\r\n2-\_ I see, I know that's reasonable
    I'll wait until adults can join to the next one as well."
