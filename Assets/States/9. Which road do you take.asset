  storyText: That trick pull off, and now I'm driving your way out and there is not
    much traffic luckily, when I reach the main crossroad I can go to the next nearest
    city or take a risky unknow path...
  conversationText: "1- That other city has news that was blasted as well, I'll only
    get from onw hellhole to another, but I have few fuel, going anywhere else is
    more crazy.\r\n2-  The luck is by my side, maybe if I take a destination somewhat
    random I will meet some refuge camp and be safe from the cities chaos."
