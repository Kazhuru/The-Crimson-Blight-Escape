  storyText: I have only saw from a friend of mine how to access the control of a
    car without the keys, how different can be motorcycles, is now or never to be
    able to do that, I recently see that the owner of that deportive red one leaved
    with a rush on his way to the enter, I'll probably have like 10 minutes to make
    this work...
