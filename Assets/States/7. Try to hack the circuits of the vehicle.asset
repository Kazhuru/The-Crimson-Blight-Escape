  storyText: I see some weird wires with the pocket knife that I always carry around,
    I remember if I can connect this one with the power source the engine will start
    without a key, or that's what I remember, or maybe that black wire will do the
    trick?...
  conversationText: "1- Let's hope on my memory and connect the red circuit to the
    power source.\r\n2- Let's improvise and connect the red one with the black one,
    and probably a kick will do."
